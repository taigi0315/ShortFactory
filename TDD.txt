Updated System Design for Automated YouTube Shorts Creation
1. Content Generation Pipeline
Script Generation
Create an LLM prompt template like this:
Copy
Generate an engaging 30-60 second script about {game_name}. Include:
- A hook in the first 3 seconds that captures attention
- 2-3 interesting facts or features about the game
- A clear conclusion with a call to action
Format the script with timestamps for narration pacing.
Match the tone: {tone_selection} (options: energetic, informative, humorous, dramatic)
Target audience: {target_audience} (options: casual gamers, competitive players, new players)
Visual Asset Selection
Implement an API connection to stock video/image services, game footage repositories, and screen recording tools
Create a prompt to guide visual selection:
Copy
Based on this script about {game_name}, identify key visual moments needed:
[SCRIPT]

For each section, describe the specific visual that should appear, including:
- Type (gameplay footage, static image, animation)
- Content description (specific moments, transitions, effects)
- Timing (when it should appear in the video)
- Visual style (matching selected style template)
Audio Selection
Include background music API integration (e.g., Epidemic Sound, Artlist)
Music selection prompt:
Copy
Based on this gaming script about {game_name} with a {tone_selection} tone, 
suggest appropriate background music that:
- Matches the energy level of the content
- Won't overpower narration
- Fits {target_audience} preferences
- Changes appropriately between script sections
2. Technical Implementation
Core Components
Input Interface: Web form for parameters (game name, tone, target audience, style template)
LLM Integration: Connect to Claude, GPT-4 or similar for script generation
Media Selection Engine: AI-based system to match script sections with appropriate visuals
Audio System:
Text-to-speech with natural inflection (ElevenLabs or similar)
Background music selection and mixing
Optional sound effect integration
Video Assembly: Automated editing tool using FFMPEG or a similar library
Caption Generator: Create timed captions from the script with style templates
Analytics Module: Performance tracking and feedback system
Style Customization System
Implement template library with options:
Caption styles (TikTok-style, gaming-focused, minimal, bold)
Visual filters and transitions
Font selections and animation types
Color schemes based on game branding or popular aesthetics
Allow saving custom templates for consistent branding
Analytics Integration
Connect to YouTube API for performance metrics
Track:
Viewer retention at different points in the video
Engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares)
Audience demographics
Implement feedback loop to LLM for script improvement based on performance
3. Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Core Functionality (Weeks 1-3)
Set up backend architecture (Python, Flask/FastAPI)
Implement LLM integration for script generation
Build basic TTS narration system
Create simple video assembly with static templates
Implement YouTube upload functionality
Phase 2: Enhanced Media Features (Weeks 4-6)
Develop media selection engine
Implement style template system
Build audio mixing capabilities
Create caption overlay system with animations
Test end-to-end workflow
Phase 3: Analytics & Optimization (Weeks 7-9)
Implement YouTube Analytics API integration
Build performance dashboard
Create feedback loop to script generation
Add batch processing capabilities
Implement A/B testing for different style templates
Phase 4: UI & Production Readiness (Weeks 10-12)
Develop user-friendly web interface
Add template customization tools
Implement user accounts and history
Create sharing and collaboration features
Final testing and optimization
4. Technical Requirements
Backend: Python with Flask/FastAPI
Frontend: React/Vue.js for dashboard interface
Database: PostgreSQL for user data, MongoDB for template storage
LLM Access: API connections to your preferred LLM provider
Media Processing: FFMPEG for video manipulation, OpenCV for visual effects
TTS Integration: ElevenLabs or similar for narration
Music API: Epidemic Sound, Artlist, or similar
Storage: AWS S3 or GCP Storage for assets and output videos
Analytics: Custom solution integrating with YouTube Analytics API
Deployment: Docker containers on AWS/GCP/Azure
Security: API key management, user authentication, content validation
5. Cost Considerations
LLM API usage: ~$0.01-0.10 per script generation
TTS API: ~$0.10-0.50 per video narration
Media services: ~$20-50/month subscription
Cloud hosting: ~$50-100/month
Storage: ~$0.10-0.30 per video
Estimated total per video: $0.50-2.00 plus fixed monthly costs
