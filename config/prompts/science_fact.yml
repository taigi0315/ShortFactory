# Science Fact Creator Configuration
content_prompt: |
    Create an engaging and educational short video about a fascinating science fact. 
    The video should focus on: {detail}
    
    Guidelines:
    - Present the information in a clear and engaging way
    - Use simple language to explain complex concepts
    - Include interesting visual elements that help explain the concept
    - Make the content memorable and shareable
    - End with a thought-provoking question or call to action
    The guidelines for creating compelling educational content are designed to engage a diverse audience spanning ages 8 to 80, encompassing science enthusiasts, curious learners, and educators. At the heart of these guidelines is a commitment to making complex ideas accessible and exciting.
    The emotional and intellectual landscape of the content should be vibrant and welcoming, striking a delicate balance between academic rigor and narrative warmth. Communication must be simultaneously precise and conversational, using language that feels like an invitation to explore rather than a lecture. The goal is to transform potentially intimidating scientific concepts into journeys of discovery that spark curiosity and wonder.
    Content should be strategically structured across multiple layers of comprehension. The first layer provides clear, fundamental explanations that serve as a welcoming entry point. The second layer delves deeper, offering contextual insights and drawing connections across different disciplines. The final layer hints at cutting-edge research and future possibilities, providing a tantalizing glimpse into the ongoing evolution of scientific understanding.
    Engagement is achieved through strategic storytelling techniques, including relatable analogies, breaking down complex concepts into digestible segments, and consistently encouraging critical thinking. Every piece of content should serve as an intellectual catalyst, transforming passive reading into an active exploration of knowledge.
    Ethical considerations are paramount. The content must promote diverse perspectives, use inclusive language, and above all, nurture a universal sense of scientific curiosity. Success is measured not by technical complexity, but by the audience's level of engagement, clarity of comprehension, and most importantly, the inspiration to continue learning.
    The ultimate aim is to create educational content that doesn't just inform, but transformsâ€”turning each reader into an active, excited participant in the grand narrative of human knowledge.

    Guidelines for captions:
    - Hook your audience with a surprising statement or question about a key scene element, like "What?! banana is radiation?" or "Human body can glow?!", and add an emoji for impact, such as  or , to make the caption intriguing, unexpected, and tied to the scene.
